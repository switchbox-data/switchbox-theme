Unlike residents of large multifamily buildings, where the savings from rooftop solar get diluted over many units, these households may be able to meaningfully cut their electricity bills by installing panels.\n\nIn total, making the tax credit fully refundable could benefit up to 63% of all highly energy-burdened families in New York.\n\n# Findings\n\n## Rooftop Solar Gap\n\nWhile **25%** of all homeowners made less than $50,000 a year, these households installed only 10% of solar projects between 2010 and 2022. This is New York State’s **rooftop solar gap**.\n\nIf solar was being deployed equitably, we’d expect homeowners with annual incomes under $50,000 to receive a quarter of the state’s rooftop solar projects, not a tenth. Closing the solar gap would require growing these homeowners’ share of the solar installation pie by 2.5x.\n\n### Unequal installation rates\n\nTo understand what’s behind New York’s inequitable distribution of rooftop solar, we must examine solar installation rates.\n\nThe contrast with higher-income households is striking: those with annual incomes above $50,000 are 2.5x more likely to have panels than those below.\n\nBut it is not the case that the higher a household’s income, the more likely they are to have solar panels on their roof. In fact, solar penetration rates are similar for all income buckets above $50,000, ranging from 22 to 27 households per project.'\n\n### Discussion\n\nWhat could be driving this “two tier” disparity in installation rates?\n\n::: column-margin\n{{< embed notebooks/analysis.qmd#fig-yearly-spending >}}\n:::\n\nHigh up-front costs: solar panels[^4] are expensive, costing tens of thousands of dollars to install, so lower income people often can’t afford them.
